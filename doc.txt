This is not the complete proyect. c2V seems to come from openCV
LSM is a libratry for linear CSM, but is not present in this repo.


3Dposition.py
	Used to get images for calibration
	Reads images from cameras detects circles in them and stores their
	2D position in camera space.
	Waits for keystroke before next set of images is adquired.
	2D positions are stored on txt files.

	Defines a function (using image) to determine the pos of circles on
	the picture

AMT.py and AMTnode.py
	Used to read platform data.
	Publish data on a txt file.
	Does not seem to sync to images.

cameraX.py
	function get_image_mako -> reads one frame from the camera
	
color.py
	Changes the color of the recorded image (c2v)

image.py
	Defines fucntion for preprocessing image and finding circles.

NEP_master.py

reconst3D.py
	Takes the camera positiond and reconstructs 3D marker position using
	LSM
